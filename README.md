# documentation-tab-grouper
The introduction of 'Tab Groups' to Google Chrome really was the best thing since sliced bread. But, if you're anything like me, groupping all of your documentation tabs together simply isn't enough.
This chrome extension will allow the user to define theyre own tab group templates and automatically group all of their tabs by the click of a button!
